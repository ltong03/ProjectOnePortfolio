   <h1>my name is lindsey elizabeth tong</h1>
   <img src="img/lindsey.png">
   <p>I love going on hikes around the Bay Area <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/
   us/california/glen-canyon-park-trail">especially this trail at Glen Canyon.</a>
   <br>
   I like bringing my dog on hikes too but some trails don't allow him. He also gets
   aggressive around other dogs sometimes but loves humans. </p>
